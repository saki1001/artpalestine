To make a hyperlink:<br/>
<br/>
1. Copy the web page address that you want to link to. The easiest way to do this is to highlight the link (something like http://www.google.com) and hit COMMAND-C.<br/>
<br/>
2. Highlight the text that you want people to click on.<br/>
<br/>
3. Click on the little chain button: <img src="/img/button.jpg"><br/>
<br/>
4. Where it says 'Link URL', enter the web address that you want people to go to. Do this by pasting the web address into this window, using COMMAND-V to paste.<br/>
